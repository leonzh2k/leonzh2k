### About me

I write software because I like building things, solving problems, and helping people. Currently, I'm the lead developer on <a href="https://coauthor.fly.dev/" target="_blank">Coauthor</a>, a platform for academic researchers to share their manuscript peer review data and help each other discover journals with fairer review processes.

When I'm not programming, I enjoy listening to music, photography, hiking, and playing video games. 

### What I'm building now:
- <a href="https://coauthor.fly.dev/" target="_blank">Coauthor</a> - platform for academic researchers to share their manuscript peer review data and help each other discover journals with fairer review processes.

### What I've built previously
- <a href="https://iacoped.github.io/coped-designermap/">CoPED Designer Map</a> - Interactive map promoting the work of 200+ publicly engaged designers around the world. Client: Collective of Publicly Engaged Designers (CoPED).
- <a href="https://visaudio.fly.dev/">Visaudio</a> - Browser-based tool for creating audio-reactive visuals.
